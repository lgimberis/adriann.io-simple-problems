 1. Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.
 2. Write function that reverses a list, preferably in place.
 3. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.
 4. Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.
 5. Write a function that computes the running total of a list.
 6. Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
 7. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a for-loop, 
   a while-loop and recursion. 
 8. Write a function on_all that applies a function to every element of a list. Use it to 
   print the first twenty perfect squares.
 9. Write a function that concatenates two lists. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]
10. Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3].
